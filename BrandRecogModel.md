## Brand Recognition Deep Learning Model 

**Project Overview:** As the mobile device has transitioned to becoming the most popular computer in the world, the need for more applications to be developed for the mobile device has increased in demand.  We attempt to integrate a deep learning model developed using Anaconda distribution of Python, PyTorch, and NVIDEA GPU accessed using Cuda libraries.  The technology was developed as a Flutter mobile application.  We discussion the process of developing the application as well as any obstacles encountered in the process.
