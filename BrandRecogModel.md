## Brand Recognition Deep Learning Model 

**Project Overview:** As the mobile device has transitioned to becoming the most popular computer in the world, the need for more applications to be developed for the mobile device has increased in demand.  We attempt to integrate a deep learning model developed using NVIDEA GPU, PyTorch, and Cuda into a Flutter mobile application.  We discussion the process of developing the application as well as any obstacles encountered in the process.     


**Roles & Responsibilities:** Designing the user interface (UI) using appropriate color schemes, dimensions, and features to maximize the quality of the user experience (UX) on <a href="https://beta.dollarmetro.com/dashboard">DollarMetro</a>.  Developing logos and graphics to be used as specialty icons throughout the <a href="https://beta.dollarmetro.com/dashboard">DollarMetro</a> website.  Researching and developing solutions for implementing appropriate functionality of all the features (buttons, menus, forms, and etc) of the UI for <a href="https://beta.dollarmetro.com/dashboard">DollarMetro</a> using React, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.  Developing the proper calls to the websites application programming interface (API) to ensure that the flow of data is fast, responsive, and logical throughout <a href="https://beta.dollarmetro.com/dashboard">DollarMetro</a> website.  Working with a back-end engineer to setup the API contract between the front-end and back-end.  Maintaining and updating the website using GitHub source control features (pushing, pulling, and rebasing).
